programmers, including lists of tutorials."
Is there a newsgroup or mailing list devoted to Python?,"There is a newsgroup, *comp.lang.python*, and a mailing list, python-
list.  The newsgroup and mailing list are gatewayed into each other --
if you can read news it's unnecessary to subscribe to the mailing
list. *comp.lang.python* is high-traffic, receiving hundreds of
postings every day, and Usenet readers are often more able to cope
with this volume.

"
Where in the world is python located?,"The Python project's infrastructure is located all over the world and
is managed by the Python Infrastructure Team. "
Why is it called Python?,"When Guido van Rossum began implementing Python,  he was also reading
the published scripts from ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"", a BBC
comedy series from the 1970s.  Van Rossum thought he needed a name
that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call
the language Python."
How stable is Python?,"Very stable.  New, stable releases have been coming out roughly every
6 to 18 months since 1991, and this seems likely to continue.  As of
version 3.9, Python will have a major new release every 12 months
(**PEP 602**).

"
How many people are using Python?,"There are probably millions of users, though it's difficult to obtain
an exact count.
"
Have any significant projects been done in Python?,"See https://www.python.org/about/success for a list of projects that
use Python. Consulting the proceedings for past Python conferences
will reveal contributions from many different companies and
organizations.

"
What new developments are expected for Python in the future?,"See https://www.python.org/dev/peps/ for the Python Enhancement
Proposals (PEPs). PEPs are design documents describing a suggested new
feature for Python, providing a concise technical specification and a
rationale.  Look for a PEP titled ""Python X.Y Release Schedule"", where
X.Y is a version that hasn't been publicly released yet.
"
Is it reasonable to propose incompatible changes to Python?,"In general, no.  There are already millions of lines of Python code
around the world, so any change in the language that invalidates more
than a very small fraction of existing programs has to be frowned
upon.  "
Is Python a good language for beginning programmers?,"Yes.
Python has a very simple and consistent syntax and a large
standard library and, most importantly, using Python in a beginning
programming course lets students concentrate on important programming
skills such as problem decomposition and data type design.  With
Python, students can be quickly introduced to basic concepts such as
loops and procedures.  T"
Why does Python use indentation for grouping of statements?,"Guido van Rossum believes that using indentation for grouping is
extremely elegant and contributes a lot to the clarity of the average
Python program. Most people learn to love this feature after a while.

"
Why are Python strings immutable?,"There are several advantages.

One is performance: knowing that a string is immutable means we can
allocate space for it at creation time, and the storage requirements
are fixed and unchanging.  This is also one of the reasons for the
distinction between tuples and lists.

Another advantage is that strings in Python are considered as
""elemental"" as numbers.  No amount of activity will change the value 8
to anything else, and in Python, no amount of activity will change the
string ""eight"" to anything else."
Why must 'self' be used explicitly in method definitions and calls?,"
First, it's more obvious that you are using a method or instance
attribute instead of a local variable.  

Second, it means that no special syntax is necessary if you want to
explicitly reference or call the method from a particular class. 

"
Why can't I use an assignment in an expression?,"Starting in Python 3.8, you can!

Assignment expressions using the walrus operator *:=* assign a
variable in an expression: while chunk := fp.read(200): print(chunk)"
Why does Python use methods for some functionality like list.index()  but functions for other like len(list)?,"For some operations, prefix notation just reads better than
   postfix -- prefix (and infix!) operations have a long tradition in
   mathematics which likes notations where the visuals help the
   mathematician thinking about a problem. Compare the easy with which
   we rewrite a formula like x*(a+b) into x*a + x*b to the clumsiness
   of doing the same thing using a raw OO notation."
Why is join() a string method instead of a list or tuple method?,"Strings became much more like other standard types starting in Python
1.6, when methods were added which give the same functionality that
has always been available using the functions of the string module.
Most of these new methods have been widely accepted, but the one which
appears to make some programmers feel uncomfortable is:
   "", "".join(['1', '2', '4', '8', '16'])
which gives the result:   ""1, 2, 4, 8, 16""

""join()"" is a string method because in using it you are telling the
separator string to iterate over a sequence of strings and insert
itself between adjacent elements.  This method can be used with any
argument which obeys the rules for sequence objects, including any new
classes you might define yourself. Similar methods exist for bytes and
bytearray objects."
How fast are exceptions?,"A try/except block is extremely efficient if no exceptions are raised.


  "
Why isn't there a switch or case statement in Python?,"You can do this easily enough with a sequence of ""if... elif...
elif... else"". There have been some proposals for switch statement
syntax, but there is no consensus (yet) on whether and how to do range
tests.  "
Can't you emulate threads in the interpreter instead of relying on an OS-specific thread implementation?,"Unfortunately, the interpreter pushes at least one C stack
frame for each Python stack frame.  Also, extensions can call back
into Python at almost random moments.  Therefore, a complete threads
implementation requires thread support for C."
Why can't lambda expressions contain statements?,"Python lambda expressions cannot contain statements because Python's
syntactic framework can't handle statements nested inside expressions.
However, in Python, this is not a serious problem.  Unlike lambda
forms in other languages, where they add functionality, Python lambdas
are only a shorthand notation if you're too lazy to define a function."
"Can Python be compiled to machine code, C or some other language?","Cython compiles a modified version of Python with optional annotations
into C extensions.  Nuitka is an up-and-coming compiler of Python into
C++ code, aiming to support the full Python language. For compiling to
Java you can consider VOC."
How does Python manage memory?,"The details of Python memory management depend on the implementation.
The standard implementation of Python, *CPython*, uses reference
counting to detect inaccessible objects, and another mechanism to
collect reference cycles, periodically executing a cycle detection
algorithm which looks for inaccessible cycles and deletes the objects
involved. The ""gc"" module provides functions to perform a garbage
collection, obtain debugging statistics, and tune the collector's
parameters."
Why doesn't CPython use a more traditional garbage collection scheme?,"For one thing, this is not a C standard feature and hence it's not
portable. (Yes, we know about the Boehm GC library.  It has bits of
assembler code for *most* common platforms, not for all of them, and
although it is mostly transparent, it isn't completely transparent;
patches are required to get Python to work with it.)
"
Why isn't all memory freed when CPython exits?,"Objects referenced from the global namespaces of Python modules are
not always deallocated when Python exits.  This may happen if there
are circular references.  There are also certain bits of memory that
are allocated by the C library that are impossible to free (e.g. a
tool like Purify will complain about these).  Python is, however,
aggressive about cleaning up memory on exit and does try to destroy
every single object.

If you want to force Python to delete certain things on deallocation
use the ""atexit"" module to run a function that will force those
deletions."
Why are there separate tuple and list data types?,"

Lists are more like arrays in other languages.
They tend to hold a varying number of objects all of which have the
same type and which are operated on one-by-one.  For example,
""os.listdir('.')"" returns a list of strings representing the files in
the current directory.  Functions which operate on this output would
generally not break if you added another file or two to the directory.

Tuples are immutable, meaning that once a tuple has been created, you
can't replace any of its elements with a new value.  Lists are
mutable, meaning that you can always change a list's elements.  Only
immutable elements can be used as dictionary keys, and hence only
tuples and not lists can be used as keys."
How are lists implemented in CPython?,"CPython's lists are really variable-length arrays, not Lisp-style
linked lists. The implementation uses a contiguous array of references
to other objects, and keeps a pointer to this array and the array's
length in a list head structure.

This makes indexing a list ""a[i]"" an operation whose cost is
independent of the size of the list or the value of the index.

When items are appended or inserted, the array of references is
resized.  Some cleverness is applied to improve the performance of
appending items repeatedly; when the array must be grown, some extra
space is allocated so the next few times don't require an actual
resize."
How are dictionaries implemented in CPython?,"
CPython's dictionaries are implemented as resizable hash tables.
Compared to B-trees, this gives better performance for lookup (the
most common operation by far) under most circumstances, and the
implementation is simpler.

Dictionaries work by computing a hash code for each key stored in the
dictionary using the ""hash()"" built-in function.  "
Why must dictionary keys be immutable?,"

If you want a dictionary indexed with a list, simply convert the list
to a tuple first; the function ""tuple(L)"" creates a tuple with the
same entries as the list ""L"".  Tuples are immutable and can therefore
be used as dictionary keys."
Why doesn't list.sort() return the sorted list?,"In situations where performance matters, making a copy of the list
just to sort it would be wasteful. Therefore, ""list.sort()"" sorts the
list in place. In order to remind you of that fact, it does not return
the sorted list.  This way, you won't be fooled into accidentally
overwriting a list when you need a sorted copy but also need to keep
the unsorted version around.
"
How do you specify and enforce an interface spec in Python?,"An interface specification for a module as provided by languages such
as C++ and Java describes the prototypes for the methods and functions
of the module.  Many feel that compile-time enforcement of interface
specifications helps in the construction of large programs.

"
Why is there no goto?,"

One can also use exceptions to provide a ""structured goto"" that works
even across function calls.  Many feel that exceptions can
conveniently emulate all reasonable uses of the ""go"" or ""goto""
constructs of C, Fortran, and other languages. "
Why can't raw strings or r-strings end with a backslash?,"

Raw strings were designed to ease creating input for processors
(chiefly regular expression engines) that want to do their own
backslash escape processing. Such processors consider an unmatched
trailing backslash to be an error anyway, so raw strings disallow
that.  In return, they allow you to pass on the string quote character
by escaping it with a backslash.  These rules work well when r-strings
are used for their intended purpose.
"
"Why doesn't Python have a ""with"" statement for attribute assignments?","Python has a 'with' statement that wraps the execution of a block,
calling code on the entrance and exit from the block.  
In Python, such a construct would be ambiguous."
Why are colons required for the if/while/def/class statements?,"The colon is required primarily to enhance readability (one of the
results of the experimental ABC language). 

Another minor reason is that the colon makes it easier for editors
with syntax highlighting; they can look for colons to decide when
indentation needs to be increased instead of having to do a more
elaborate parsing of the program text."
Why does Python allow commas at the end of lists and tuples?,"Python lets you add a trailing comma at the end of lists, tuples, and
dictionaries:
There are several reasons to allow this.

When you have a literal value for a list, tuple, or dictionary spread
across multiple lines, it's easier to add more elements because you
don't have to remember to add a comma to the previous line.  The lines
can also be reordered without creating a syntax error.

Accidentally omitting the comma can lead to errors that are hard to
diagnose. 

Allowing the trailing comma may also make programmatic code generation
easier."
Can I create my own functions in C?,"Yes, you can create built-in modules containing functions, variables,
exceptions and even new types in C.  This is explained in the document
Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter."
Can I create my own functions in C++?,"Yes, using the C compatibility features found in C++.  Place ""extern
""C"" { ... }"" around the Python include files and put ""extern ""C""""
before each function that is going to be called by the Python
interpreter.  Global or static C++ objects with constructors are
probably not a good idea."
How can I execute arbitrary Python statements from C?,"The highest-level function to do this is ""PyRun_SimpleString()"" which
takes a single string argument to be executed in the context of the
module ""__main__"" and returns ""0"" for success and ""-1"" when an
exception occurred (including ""SyntaxError"").  If you want more
control, use ""PyRun_String()""; see the source for
""PyRun_SimpleString()"" in ""Python/pythonrun.c""."
How can I evaluate an arbitrary Python expression from C?,"Call the function ""PyRun_String()"" from the previous question with the
start symbol ""Py_eval_input""; it parses an expression, evaluates it
and returns its value."
How do I extract C values from a Python object?,"That depends on the object's type.  If it's a tuple, ""PyTuple_Size()""
returns its length and ""PyTuple_GetItem()"" returns the item at a
specified index.  Lists have similar functions, ""PyListSize()"" and
""PyList_GetItem()"".

For bytes, ""PyBytes_Size()"" returns its length and
""PyBytes_AsStringAndSize()"" provides a pointer to its value and its
length.  Note that Python bytes objects may contain null bytes so C's
""strlen()"" should not be used."
How do I use Py_BuildValue() to create a tuple of arbitrary length?,"You can't.  Use ""PyTuple_Pack()"" instead."
How do I call an object's method from C?,"The ""PyObject_CallMethod()"" function can be used to call an arbitrary
method of an object.  The parameters are the object, the name of the
method to call, a format string like that used with ""Py_BuildValue()"",
and the argument values"
How do I catch the output from PyErr_Print() or anything that prints to stdout/stderr?,"In Python code, define an object that supports the ""write()"" method.
Assign this object to ""sys.stdout"" and ""sys.stderr"".  Call
print_error, or just allow the standard traceback mechanism to work.
Then, the output will go wherever your ""write()"" method sends it.
"
How do I access a module written in Python from C?,"You can get a pointer to the module object using ImportModule keyword.

If the module hasn't been imported yet (i.e. it is not yet present in
""sys.modules""), this initializes the module; otherwise it simply
returns the value of ""sys.modules[""<modulename>""]"".  Note that it
doesn't enter the module into any namespace -- it only ensures it has
been initialized and is stored in ""sys.modules"".
"
How do I interface to C++ objects from Python?,"Depending on your requirements, there are many approaches.  To do this
manually, begin by reading the ""Extending and Embedding"" document.
Realize that for the Python run-time system, there isn't a whole lot
of difference between C and C++ -- so the strategy of building a new
Python type around a C structure (pointer) type will also work for C++
objects."
I added a module using the Setup file and the make fails; why?,"Setup must end in a newline, if there is no newline there, the build
process fails.  (Fixing this requires some ugly shell script hackery,
and this bug is so minor that it doesn't seem worth the effort.)"
How do I debug an extension?,"When using GDB with dynamically loaded extensions, you can't set a
breakpoint in your extension until your extension is loaded.
"
"I want to compile a Python module on my Linux system, but some files are missing. Why?","Most packaged versions of Python don't include the
""/usr/lib/python2.*x*/config/"" directory, which contains various files
required for compiling Python extensions.

For Red Hat, install the python-devel RPM to get the necessary files.

For Debian, run ""apt-get install python-dev""."
"How do I tell ""incomplete input"" from ""invalid input""?","Sometimes you want to emulate the Python interactive interpreter's
behavior, where it gives you a continuation prompt when the input is
incomplete (e.g. you typed the start of an ""if"" statement or you
didn't close your parentheses or triple string quotes), but it gives
you a syntax error message immediately when the input is invalid.

In Python you can use the ""codeop"" module, which approximates the
parser's behavior sufficiently.  IDLE uses this, for example.

"
How do I find undefined g++ symbols __builtin_new or __pure_virtual?,"To dynamically load g++ extension modules, you must recompile Python,
relink it using g++ (change LINKCC in the Python Modules Makefile),
and link your extension module using g++ (e.g., ""g++ -shared -o
mymodule.so mymodule.o"")."
Can I create an object class with some methods implemented in C and others in Python like through inheritance?,"Yes, you can inherit from built-in classes such as ""int"", ""list"",
""dict"", etc.

The Boost Python Library (BPL,
http://www.boost.org/libs/python/doc/index.html) provides a way of
doing this from C++ (i.e. you can inherit from an extension class
written in C++ using the BPL)."
How do I find a module or application to perform task X?,"Check the Library Reference to see if there's a relevant standard library module.For third-party packages, search the Python Package Index or try Google or another Web search engine.  "
What are the different kinds of modules in python?,"There are (at least) three kinds of modules in Python:

1. modules written in Python (.py);

2. modules written in C and dynamically loaded (.dll, .pyd, .so, .sl,
   etc);

3. modules written in C and linked with the interpreter; to get a list
   of these, type:

How do I make a Python script executable on Unix?,"You need to do two things: the script file's mode must be executable and the first line must begin with ""#!"" followed by the path of the Python interpreter.
The first is done by executing ""chmod +x scriptfile"" or perhaps ""chmod
755 scriptfile"".
The second can be done in a number of ways.  The most straightforward
way is to write
  #!/usr/local/bin/python

as the very first line of your file, using the pathname for where the
Python interpreter is installed on your platform."
Is there an equivalent to C's onexit() in Python?,"The ""atexit"" module provides a register function that is similar to
C's ""onexit()""."
Why don't my signal handlers work?,"The most common problem is that the signal handler is declared with
the wrong argument list.  It is called as

   handler(signum, frame)

so it should be declared with two parameters:

   def handler(signum, frame):

How do I create documentation from doc strings?,"The ""pydoc"" module can create HTML from the doc strings in your Python
source code.  An alternative for creating API documentation purely
from docstrings is epydoc.  Sphinx can also include docstring content."
How do I get a single keypress at a time?,"For Unix variants there are several solutions.  It's straightforward
to do this using curses, but curses is a fairly large module to learn."
How do I program using threads?,"Be sure to use the ""threading"" module and not the ""_thread"" module. The ""threading"" module builds convenient abstractions on top of the low-level primitives provided by the ""_thread"" module."
"
None of my threads seem to run why?","
As soon as the main thread exits, all threads are killed.  Your main thread is running too quickly, giving the threads no time to do any work.A simple fix is to add a sleep to the end of the program that's long enough for all the threads to finish."
"
How do I parcel out work among a bunch of worker threads?","The easiest way is to use the ""concurrent.futures"" module, especially the ""ThreadPoolExecutor"" class. Or, if you want fine control over the dispatching algorithm, you can write your own logic manually.  Use the ""queue"" module to create a
queue containing a list of jobs.  The ""Queue"" class maintains a list of objects and has a "".put(obj)"" method that adds items to the queue and a "".get()"" method to return them.  The class will take care of the locking necessary to ensure that each job is handed out exactly once.
"
How do I generate random numbers in Python?,"The standard module ""random"" implements a random number generator.
Usage is simple:
   import random
   random.random()

This returns a random floating point number in the range [0, 1).

"
How do you implement persistent objects in Python?,"
The ""pickle"" library module solves this in a very general way (though
you still can't store things like open files, sockets or windows), and
the ""shelve"" library module uses pickle and (g)dbm to create
persistent mappings containing arbitrary Python objects."
Are there any interfaces to database packages in Python?,"Yes.
Interfaces to disk-based hashes such as ""DBM"" and ""GDBM"" are also
included with standard Python.  There is also the ""sqlite3"" module,
which provides a lightweight disk-based relational database.

"
How do I avoid blocking in the connect() method of a socket?,"The ""select"" module is commonly used to help with asynchronous I/O on
sockets.
"
How do I delete a file?,"Use ""os.remove(filename)"" or ""os.unlink(filename)""."
How do I copy a file?,"The ""shutil"" module contains a ""copyfile()"" function.  Note that on
MacOS 9 it doesn't copy the resource fork and Finder info."
How do I read or write binary data?,"To read or write complex binary data formats, it's best to use the
""struct"" module.  It allows you to take a string containing binary
data (usually numbers) and convert it to Python objects; and vice
versa.

"
I can't seem to use os.read() on a pipe created with os.popen() why?,"""os.read()"" is a low-level function which takes a file descriptor, a
small integer representing the opened file.  ""os.popen()"" creates a
high-level file object, the same type returned by the built-in
""open()"" function. Thus, to read *n* bytes from a pipe *p* created
with ""os.popen()"", you need to use ""p.read(n)""."
Why doesn't closing sys.stdout/stdin/stderr really close it?,"Stdin, stdout and stderr are treated specially by Python, because
of the special status  given to them by C.  Running
""sys.stdout.close()"" marks the Python-level file object as being
closed, but does *not* close the associated C file descriptor.

To close the underlying C file descriptor for one of these three, you
should first be sure that's what you really want to do (e.g., you may
confuse extension modules trying to do I/O).  If it is, use
""os.close()"":"
"
How do I parcel out work among a bunch of worker threads?","
The easiest way is to use the ""concurrent.futures"" module, especially
the ""ThreadPoolExecutor"" class."
What kinds of global value mutation are thread-safe?,"
A *global interpreter lock* (GIL) is used internally to ensure that
only one thread runs in the Python VM at a time.  In general, Python
offers to switch among threads only between bytecode instructions.

"
What is Global Interpreter Lock?,"The *global interpreter lock* (GIL) is often seen as a hindrance to
Python's deployment on high-end multiprocessor server machines,
because a multi-threaded Python program effectively only uses one CPU,
due to the insistence that (almost) all Python code can only run while
the GIL is held."
How do I test a Python program or component?,"Python comes with two testing frameworks.  The ""doctest"" module finds
examples in the docstrings for a module and runs them, comparing the
output with the expected output given in the docstring.The ""unittest"" module is a fancier testing framework modelled on Java
and Smalltalk testing frameworks."
How do I make Python scripts executable?,"On Windows, the standard Python installer already associates the .py
extension with a file type (Python.File) and gives that file type an
open command that runs the interpreter (""D:\Program
Files\Python\python.exe ""%1"" %*"").  This is enough to make scripts
executable from the command prompt as 'foo.py'.  If you'd rather be
able to execute the script by simple typing 'foo' with no extension
you need to add .py to the PATHEXT environment variable.
"
Why does Python sometimes take so long to start?,"The problem may be caused by a misconfiguration of virus checking
software on the problem machine.  Some virus scanners have been known
to introduce startup overhead of two orders of magnitude when the
scanner is configured to monitor all reads from the filesystem.  Try
checking the configuration of virus scanning software on your systems
to ensure that they are indeed configured identically. McAfee, when
configured to scan all file system read activity, is a particular
offender."
"
How do I make an executable from a Python script?","See cx_Freeze for a distutils extension that allows you to create
console and GUI executables from Python code. py2exe, the most popular
extension for building Python 2.x-based executables, does not yet
support Python 3 but a version that does is in development."
"
Is a ""*.pyd"" file the same as a DLL?","Yes, .pyd files are dll's, but there are a few differences.  If you
have a DLL named ""foo.pyd"", then it must have a function
""PyInit_foo()"".  You can then write Python ""import foo"", and Python
will search for foo.pyd (as well as foo.py, foo.pyc) and if it finds
it, will attempt to call ""PyInit_foo()"" to initialize it.  You do not
link your .exe with foo.lib, as that would cause Windows to require
the DLL to be present."
How can I embed Python into a Windows application?,"Embedding the Python interpreter in a Windows app can be summarized as
follows:

1. Do _not_ build Python into your .exe file directly.  On Windows,
   Python must be a DLL to handle importing modules that are
   themselves DLL's.  (This is the first key undocumented fact.)
   Instead, link to ""python*NN*.dll""; it is typically installed in
   ""C:\Windows\System"".  *NN* is the Python version, a number such as
   ""33"" for Python 3.3.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2. If you use SWIG, it is easy to create a Python ""extension module""
   that will make the app's data and methods available to Python.
   SWIG will handle just about all the grungy details for you.  The
   result is C code that you link *into* your .exe file (!)  You do
   _not_ have to create a DLL file, and this also simplifies linking."
How do I keep editors from inserting tabs into my Python source?,"Under any editor, mixing tabs and spaces is a bad idea.  MSVC is no
different in this respect, and is easily configured to use spaces:
Take Tools ? Options ? Tabs, and for file type ""Default"" set ""Tab
size"" and ""Indent size"" to 4, and select the ""Insert spaces"" radio
button.

Python raises ""IndentationError"" or ""TabError"" if mixed tabs and
spaces are causing problems in leading whitespace. You may also run
the ""tabnanny"" module to check a directory tree in batch mode.
"
How do I check for a keypress without blocking?,"
Use the ""msvcrt"" module.  This is a standard Windows-specific
extension module. It defines a function ""kbhit()"" which checks whether
a keyboard hit is present, and ""getch()"" which gets one character
without echoing it."
"
How do I run a Python program under Windows?","You can download and install python from python.org[1] . Choose the executable installer as that will set up the environment to run Python for you. The python version you choose is important as version 3.x.x is significantly different than version 2.7.x. Some existing python apps out there will not run with version 3.x.x.

After installing python, you can run any source file from the command line: python scriptname.py 
Other extensions that the python interpreter also recognizes are .pyc (containing compiled bytecode), .pyo (optimized bytecode), .pyd (Windows DLL for python),…

The python .pyw is for python scripts with GUI interface. These files must be run with the pythonw command (which is also included with the Windows version of python.)"
Are there tools to help find bugs or perform static analysis?,"Yes.

Pylint and Pyflakes do basic checking that will help you catch bugs
sooner.

Static type checkers such as Mypy, Pyre, and Pytype can check type
hints in Python source code."
Are there coding standards or a style guide for Python programs?,"Yes.  The coding style required for standard library modules is
documented as **PEP 8**."
What platform-independent GUI toolkits exist for Python?,"Depending on what platform(s) you are aiming at, there are several.
Some of them haven't been ported to Python 3 yet.  At least Tkinter
and Qt are known to be Python 3-compatible.


Tkinter

wxWidgets
---------
Qt

Gtk+
----
Kivy
----
FLTK

What platform-specific GUI toolkits exist for Python?,"By installing the PyObjc Objective-C bridge, Python programs can use
Mac OS X's Cocoa libraries.

Pythonwin by Mark Hammond includes an interface to the Microsoft
Foundation Classes and a Python programming environment that's written
mostly in Python using the MFC classes."
How do I freeze Tkinter applications?,"Freeze is a tool to create stand-alone applications.  When freezing
Tkinter applications, the applications will not be truly stand-alone,
as the application will still need the Tcl and Tk libraries.

One solution is to ship the application with the Tcl and Tk libraries,
and point to them at run-time using the ""TCL_LIBRARY"" and ""TK_LIBRARY""
environment variables.

To get truly stand-alone applications, the Tcl scripts that form the
library have to be integrated into the application as well. One tool
supporting that is SAM (stand-alone modules), which is part of the Tix
distribution ."
Can I have Tk events handled while waiting for IO?,"On platforms other than Windows, yes, and you don't even need threads!
But you'll have to restructure your I/O code a bit.  Tk has the
equivalent of Xt's ""XtAddInput()"" call, which allows you to register a
callback function which will be called from the Tk mainloop when I/O
is possible on a file descriptor.  "
I can't get key bindings to work in Tkinter: why?,"An often-heard complaint is that event handlers bound to events with
the ""bind()"" method don't get handled even when the appropriate key is
pressed.

The most common cause is that the widget to which the binding applies
doesn't have ""keyboard focus"".  Check out the Tk documentation for the
focus command. Usually a widget is given the keyboard focus by
clicking in it (but not for labels; see the takefocus option).
"
Why is Python installed on my machine?,"
If you find Python installed on your system but don't remember
installing it, there are several possible ways it could have gotten
there.

* Perhaps another user on the computer wanted to learn programming and
  installed it; you'll have to figure out who's been using the machine
  and might have installed it.

* A third-party application installed on the machine might have been
  written in Python and included a Python installation.  There are
  many such applications, from GUI programs to network servers and
  administrative scripts.

* Some Windows machines also have Python installed.  At this writing
  we're aware of computers from Hewlett-Packard and Compaq that
  include Python.  Apparently some of HP/Compaq's administrative tools
  are written in Python.

* Many Unix-compatible operating systems, such as Mac OS X and some
  Linux distributions, have Python installed by default; it's included
  in the base installation."
Can I delete Python?,"That depends on where Python came from.

If someone installed it deliberately, you can remove it without
hurting anything.  On Windows, use the Add/Remove Programs icon in the
Control Panel.

If Python was installed by a third-party application, you can also
remove it, but that application will no longer work.  You should use
that application's uninstaller rather than removing Python directly.

If Python came with your operating system, removing it is not
recommended.  If you remove it, whatever tools were written in Python
will no longer run, and some of them might be important to you.
Reinstalling the whole system would then be required to fix things
again.
"
"Is there a source code level debugger with breakpoints, single-stepping, etc.?","Yes.

Several debuggers for Python are described below, and the built-in
function ""breakpoint()"" allows you to drop into any of them.

The pdb module is a simple but adequate console-mode debugger for
Python. It is part of the standard Python library. You can also write your own debugger
by using the code for pdb as an example.


PythonWin is a Python IDE that includes a GUI debugger based on pdb.
The Pythonwin debugger colors breakpoints and has quite a few cool
features such as debugging non-Pythonwin programs.  Pythonwin is
available as part of the Python for Windows Extensions project and as
a part of the ActivePython distribution (see
https://www.activestate.com/activepython)."
Are there tools to help find bugs or perform static analysis?,"Yes.

Pylint and Pyflakes do basic checking that will help you catch bugs
sooner.

Static type checkers such as Mypy, Pyre, and Pytype can check type
hints in Python source code."
How can I create a stand-alone binary from a Python script?,"
You don't need the ability to compile Python to C code if all you want
is a stand-alone program that users can download and run without
having to install the Python distribution first.  There are a number
of tools that determine the set of modules required by a program and
bind these modules together with a Python binary to produce a single
executable.

One is to use the freeze tool, which is included in the Python source
tree as ""Tools/freeze"". It converts Python byte code to C arrays; a C
compiler you can embed all your modules into a new program, which is
then linked with the standard Python modules."
Why am I getting an UnboundLocalError when the variable has a value?,"UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment

This is because when you make an assignment to a variable in a scope,
that variable becomes local to that scope and shadows any similarly
named variable in the outer scope.  Since the last statement in foo
assigns a new value to ""x"", the compiler recognizes it as a local
variable.  Consequently when the earlier ""print(x)"" attempts to print
the uninitialized local variable and an error results.
"
What are the rules for local and global variables in Python?,"
In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are
implicitly global.  If a variable is assigned a value anywhere within
the function's body, it's assumed to be a local unless explicitly
declared as global.

Though a bit surprising at first, a moment's consideration explains
this.  On one hand, requiring ""global"" for assigned variables provides
a bar against unintended side-effects.  On the other hand, if ""global""
was required for all global references, you'd be using ""global"" all
the time.  You'd have to declare as global every reference to a built-
in function or to a component of an imported module.  This clutter
would defeat the usefulness of the ""global"" declaration for
identifying side-effects."
Why do lambdas defined in a loop with different values all return the same result?,"
This happens because ""x"" is not local to the lambdas, but is defined
in the outer scope, and it is accessed when the lambda is called ---
not when it is defined.  "
How do I share global variables across modules?,"The canonical way to share information across modules within a single
program is to create a special module (often called config or cfg).
Just import the config module in all modules of your application; the
module then becomes available as a global name.  Because there is only
one instance of each module, any changes made to the module object get
reflected everywhere.  

"
"What are the ""best practices"" for using import in a module?","
In general, don't use ""from modulename import *"".  Doing so clutters
the importer's namespace, and makes it much harder for linters to
detect undefined names.

Import modules at the top of a file.  Doing so makes it clear what
other modules your code requires and avoids questions of whether the
module name is in scope. Using one import per line makes it easy to
add and delete module imports, but using multiple imports per line
uses less screen space.

It's good practice if you import modules in the following order:

1. standard library modules -- e.g. ""sys"", ""os"", ""getopt"", ""re""

2. third-party library modules (anything installed in Python's site-
   packages directory) -- e.g. mx.DateTime, ZODB, PIL.Image, etc.

3. locally-developed modules"
Why are default values shared between objects?,"It is often expected that a function call creates new objects for
default values. This is not what happens. Default values are created
exactly once, when the function is defined.  If that object is
changed, like the dictionary in this example, subsequent calls to the
function will refer to this changed object.

By definition, immutable objects such as numbers, strings, tuples, and
""None"", are safe from change. Changes to mutable objects such as
dictionaries, lists, and class instances can lead to confusion.

Because of this feature, it is good programming practice to not use
mutable objects as default values.  Instead, use ""None"" as the default
value and inside the function, check if the parameter is ""None"" and
create a new list/dictionary/whatever if it is. "
What is the difference between arguments and parameters?,"*Parameters* are defined by the names that appear in a function
definition, whereas *arguments* are the values actually passed to a
function when calling it.  Parameters define what types of arguments a
function can accept.  "
How do I write a function with output parameters like in call by reference?,"Remember that arguments are passed by assignment in Python.  Since
assignment just creates references to objects, there's no alias
between an argument name in the caller and callee, and so no call-by-
reference per se.  You can achieve the desired effect in a number of
ways.

1. By returning a tuple of the results:

2. By using global variables.  This isn't thread-safe, and is not
   recommended.

3. By passing a mutable (changeable in-place) object:


4. By passing in a dictionary that gets mutated:

5. Or bundle up values in a class instance:

Your best choice is to return a tuple containing the multiple results.
"
How can I find the methods or attributes of an object?,"For an instance x of a user-defined class, ""dir(x)"" returns an
alphabetized list of the names containing the instance attributes and
methods and attributes defined by its class.
"
How can my code discover the name of an object?,"Generally speaking, it can't, because objects don't really have names.
Essentially, assignment always binds a name to a value; the same is
true of ""def"" and ""class"" statements, but in that case the value is a
callable."
What's up with the comma operator's precedence?,"
Comma is not an operator in Python."
Is it possible to write obfuscated one-liners in Python?,"
Yes.  Usually this is done by nesting ""lambda"" within ""lambda"".  See
the following three examples, due to Ulf Bartelt:"
What does the slash in the parameter list of a function mean?,"A slash in the argument list of a function denotes that the parameters
prior to it are positional-only.  Positional-only parameters are the
ones without an externally-usable name.  Upon calling a function that
accepts positional-only parameters, arguments are mapped to parameters
based solely on their position."
How do I specify hexadecimal and octal integers?,"Hexadecimal is just as easy.  Simply precede the hexadecimal number
with a zero, and then a lower or uppercase ""x"".  Hexadecimal digits
can be specified in lower or uppercase. 
"
How do I convert a string to a number?,"For integers, use the built-in ""int()"" type constructor"
How do I convert a number to a string?,"To convert use the built-in
type constructor ""str()"".  If you want a hexadecimal or octal
representation, use the built-in functions ""hex()"" or ""oct()"".  For
fancy formatting, see the Formatted string literals and Format String
Syntax sections, "
How do I modify a string in place?,"You can't, because strings are immutable.  In most situations, you
should simply construct a new string from the various parts you want
to assemble it from.  However, if you need an object with the ability
to modify in-place unicode data, try using an ""io.StringIO"" object or
the ""array"" module:"
How do I use strings to call functions/methods?,"
* The best is to use a dictionary that maps strings to functions.  The
  primary advantage of this technique is that the strings do not need
  to match the names of the functions.  
* Use the built-in function ""getattr()"":

    
* Use ""locals()"" to resolve the function name:

  "
Is there an equivalent to Perl's chomp() for removing trailing newlines from strings?,"You can use ""S.rstrip(""\r\n"")"" to remove all occurrences of any line
terminator from the end of the string ""S"" without removing other
trailing whitespace"
Is there a scanf() or sscanf() equivalent?,"Not as such.

For simple input parsing, the easiest approach is usually to split the
line into whitespace-delimited words
"
What is the most efficient way to concatenate many strings together?,"
""str"" and ""bytes"" objects are immutable, therefore concatenating many
strings together is inefficient as each concatenation creates a new
object.  In the general case, the total runtime cost is quadratic in
the total string length.
"
My program is too slow. How do I speed it up?,"
That's a tough one, in general.  First, here are a list of things to
remember before diving further:

* Performance characteristics vary across Python implementations.
  This FAQ focuses on *CPython*.

* Behaviour can vary across operating systems, especially when talking
  about I/O or multi-threading.

* You should always find the hot spots in your program *before*
  attempting to optimize any code (see the ""profile"" module).

* Writing benchmark scripts will allow you to iterate quickly when
  searching for improvements (see the ""timeit"" module).

* It is highly recommended to have good code coverage (through unit
  testing or any other technique) before potentially introducing
  regressions hidden in sophisticated optimizations."
How do I convert between tuples and lists?,"The type constructor ""tuple(seq)"" converts any sequence (actually, any
iterable) into a tuple with the same items in the same order.

"
What's a negative index?,"Python sequences are indexed with positive numbers and negative
numbers.  For positive numbers 0 is the first index 1 is the second

How do you remove multiple items from a list,"

Using List comprehension"
How do you make an array in Python?,"
Lists are equivalent to C or Pascal arrays in their time complexity;
the primary difference is that a Python list can contain objects of
many different types.

The ""array"" module also provides methods for creating arrays of fixed
types with compact representations, but they are slower to index than
lists.  Also note that the Numeric extensions and others define array-
like structures with various characteristics as well."
How do I create a multidimensional list?,"The suggested approach is to create a list of the desired length first
and then fill in each element with a newly created list Or you can use an extension that provides a matrix datatype; NumPy is
the best known."
What is a class?,"A class is the particular object type created by executing a class
statement. Class objects are used as templates to create instance
objects, which embody both the data (attributes) and code (methods)
specific to a datatype.
"
What is a method?,"A method is a function on some object ""x"" that you normally call as
""x.name(arguments...)"".  Methods are defined as functions inside the
class definition"
What is self?,"Self is merely a conventional name for the first argument of a method.
"
What is delegation?,"Delegation is an object oriented technique (also called a design
pattern). Let's say you have an object ""x"" and want to change the
behaviour of just one of its methods.  You can create a new class that
provides a new implementation of the method you're interested in
changing and delegates all other methods to the corresponding method
of ""x"".
"
How do I call a method defined in a base class from a derived class that overrides it?,"Use the built-in ""super()"" function"
How can I organize my code to make it easier to change the base class?,"You could assign the base class to an alias and derive from the alias.
Then all you have to change is the value assigned to the alias.
"
How do I create static class data and static class methods?,"Both static data and static methods (in the sense of C++ or Java) are
supported in Python.For static data, simply define a class attribute.  To assign a new
value to the attribute, you have to explicitly use the class name in
the assignment."
How can I overload constructors (or methods) in Python?,"
In Python you have to write a single constructor that catches all
cases using default arguments. "
"
How do I get a list of all instances of a given class?","Python does not keep track of all instances of a class (or of a built-
in type). You can program the class's constructor to keep track of all
instances by keeping a list of weak references to each instance.
"
"Why does the result of ""id()"" appear to be not unique?","The ""id()"" builtin returns an integer that is guaranteed to be unique
during the lifetime of the object.  Since in CPython, this is the
object's memory address, it happens frequently that after an object is
deleted from memory, the next freshly created object is allocated at
the same position in memory.  "
When can I rely on identity tests with the *is* operator?,"The most important property of an identity test is that an object is
always identical to itself, ""a is a"" always returns ""True"".  Identity
tests are usually faster than equality tests.  And unlike equality
tests, identity tests are guaranteed to return a boolean ""True"" or
""False"".
"
How do I create a .pyc file?,"When a module is imported for the first time a "".pyc"" file
containing the compiled code should be created in a ""__pycache__""
subdirectory of the directory containing the "".py"" file.  The "".pyc""
file will have a filename that starts with the same name as the "".py""
file, and ends with "".pyc"", with a middle component that depends on
the particular ""python"" binary that created it. "
How do I find the current module name?,"
A module can find out its own module name by looking at the predefined
global variable ""__name__"".  If this has the value ""'__main__'"", the
program is running as a script.  Many modules that are usually used by
importing them also provide a command-line interface or a self-test,
and only execute this code after checking ""__name__""
"
What is the difference between list and tuples in Python?,LIST-Lists are mutable i.e they can be edited.TUPLES-Tuples are immutable (tuples are lists which can’t be edited).
What are the key features of Python?,"Python is an interpreted language. That means that, unlike languages like C and its variants, Python does not need to be compiled before it is run. Other interpreted languages include PHP and Ruby.
Python is dynamically typed, this means that you don’t need to state the types of variables when you declare them or anything like that. You can do things like x=111 and then x=""I'm a string"" without error
Python is well suited to object orientated programming in that it allows the definition of classes along with composition and inheritance. Python does not have access specifiers (like C++’s public, private).
In Python, functions are first-class objects. This means that they can be assigned to variables, returned from other functions and passed into functions. Classes are also first class objects
Writing Python code is quick but running it is often slower than compiled languages. Fortunately?Python allows the inclusion of C-based extensions so bottlenecks can be optimized away and often are. The numpy package is a good example of this, it’s really quite quick because a lot of the number-crunching it does isn’t actually done by Python
Python finds use in many spheres – web applications, automation, scientific modeling, big data applications and many more. It’s also often used as “glue” code to get other languages and components to play nice."
What type of language is python? Programming or scripting?,"Python is capable of scripting, but in general sense, it is considered as a general-purpose programming language. To know more about Scripting, you can refer to the Python Scripting Tutorial."

What is pep 8?,PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal. It is a set of rules that specify how to format Python code for maximum readability.
How is memory managed in Python?,"Memory is managed in Python in the following ways:

Memory management in python is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. The programmer does not have access to this private heap. The python interpreter takes care of this instead.
The allocation of heap space for Python objects is done by Python’s memory manager. The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code.
Python also has an inbuilt garbage collector, which recycles all the unused memory and so that it can be made available to the heap space."
What is namespace in Python?,A namespace is a naming system used to make sure that names are unique to avoid naming conflicts.

What is a lambda function?,"An anonymous function is known as a lambda function. This function can have any number of parameters but, can have just one statement."
What is self in Python?,"elf is an instance or an object of a class. In Python, this is explicitly included as the first parameter. However, this is not the case in Java where it’s optional.  It helps to differentiate between the methods and attributes of a class with local variables.

The self variable in the init method refers to the newly created object while in other methods, it refers to the object whose method was called."
"How does break, continue and pass work?","Break-Allows loop termination when some condition is met and the control is transferred to the next statement.Continue-Allows skipping some part of a loop when some specific condition is met and the control is transferred to the beginning of the loop
Pass -Used when you need some block of code syntactically, but you want to skip its execution. This is basically a null operation. Nothing happens when this is executed."
What are python iterators?,Iterators are objects which can be traversed though or iterated upon.
How can you generate random numbers in Python?,"The statement random.random() method return the floating point number that is in the range of [0, 1). The function generates random float numbers. The methods that are used with the random class are the bound methods of the hidden instances. The instances of the Random can be done to show the multi-threading programs that creates a different instance of individual threads. The other random generators that are used in this are:

randrange(a, b): it chooses an integer and define the range in-between [a, b). It returns the elements by selecting it randomly from the range that is specified. It doesn’t build a range object.
uniform(a, b): it chooses a floating point number that is defined in the range of [a,b).Iyt returns the floating point number
normalvariate(mean, sdev): it is used for the normal distribution where the mu is a mean and the sdev is a sigma that is used for standard deviation.
The Random class that is used and instantiated creates independent multiple random number generators."
What is the difference between range & xrange?,"For the most part, xrange and range are the exact same in terms of functionality. They both provide a way to generate a list of integers for you to use, however you please. The only difference is that range returns a Python list object and x range returns an xrange object.

This means that xrange doesn’t actually generate a static list at run-time like range does. It creates the values as you need them with a special technique called yielding. This technique is used with a type of object known as generators. That means that if you have a really gigantic range you’d like to generate a list for, say one billion, xrange is the function to use.

This is especially true if you have a really memory sensitive system such as a cell phone that you are working with, as range will use as much memory as it can to create your array of integers, which can result in a Memory Error and crash your program. It’s a memory hungry beast."
How do you write comments in python?,"Comments in Python start with a # character. However, alternatively at times, commenting is done using docstrings(strings enclosed within triple quotes)."

You can also a very good shortcut method to comment multiple lines. All you need to do is hold the ctrl key and left click in every place wherever you want to include a # character and type a # just once. This will comment all the lines where you introduced your cursor.
What are docstrings in Python?,"Docstrings are not actually comments, but, they are documentation strings. These docstrings are within triple quotes. They are not assigned to any variable and therefore, at times, serve the purpose of comments as well."

 Is Django better than Flask?," Django and Flask map the URL’s or addresses typed in the web browsers to functions in Python. 

Flask is much simpler compared to Django but, Flask does not do a lot for you meaning you will need to specify the details, whereas Django does a lot for you wherein you would not need to do much work. Django consists of prewritten code, which the user will need to analyze whereas Flask gives the users to create their own code, therefore, making it simpler to understand the code. Technically both are equally good and both contain their own pros and cons."

Django abstracts the process of sending and receiving cookies, by placing a session ID cookie on the client side, and storing all the related data on the server side."
List out the inheritance styles in Django.,"In Django, there are three possible inheritance styles:

Abstract Base Classes: This style is used when you only want parent’s class to hold information that you don’t want to type out for each child model.
Multi-table Inheritance: This style is used If you are sub-classing an existing model and need each model to have its own database table.
Proxy models: You can use this model, If you only want to modify the Python level behavior of the model, without changing the model’s fields."

"
What is pandas groupby?,"A pandas groupby is a feature supported by pandas which is used to split and group an object. Like the sql/mysql/oracle groupby it used to group data by classes, entities which can be further used for aggregation. A dataframe can be grouped by one or more columns."
What kind of joins does pandas offer?,"Pandas has a left join, inner join, right join and an outer join."
How to merge dataframes in pandas?,Merging depends on the type and fields of different dataframes being merged. If data is having similar fields data is merged along axis 0 else they are merged along axis 1.
What is a classifier?,A classifier is used to predict the class of any data point. Classifiers are special hypotheses that are used to assign class labels to any particular data points. A classifier often uses training data to understand the relation between input variables and the class. Classification is a method used in supervised learning in Machine Learning.
how do you convert a string into lowercase?,All the upper cases in a string can be converted into lowercase by using the method: string.lower()
How can you capitalize the first letter of a string?,We can use the capitalize() function to capitalize the first character of a string. If the first character is already in capital then it returns the original string.
How can you insert an element at a given index in Python?,Python has an inbuilt function called the insert() function.It can be used used to insert an element at a given index.
What is recursion?,"Recursion is a function calling itself one or more times in it body. One very important condition a recursive function should have to be used in a program is, it should terminate, else there would be a problem of an infinite loop."
How will you remove duplicate elements from a list?,"There are various methods to remove duplicate elements from a list. But, the most common one is, converting the list into a set by using the set() function and using the list() function to convert it back to a list, if required."
what are Python List Comprehension,"List comprehensions are used for transforming one list into another list. Elements can be conditionally included in the new list and each element can be transformed as needed. It consists of an expression leading a for clause, enclosed in brackets. for ex: list = [i for i in range(1000)]"
What is the bytes() function?,"The bytes() function returns a bytes object. It is used to convert objects into bytes objects, or create empty bytes object of the specified size."
What is a map() function in Python?,"The map() function in Python is used for applying a function on all elements of a specified iterable. It consists of two parameters, function and iterable. The function is taken as an argument and then applied to all the elements of an iterable(passed as the second argument). An object list is returned as a result."
What are the tools present to perform statics analysis?,"The two static analysis tool used to find bugs in Python are: Pychecker and Pylint. Pychecker detects bugs from the source code and warns about its style and complexity.While, Pylint checks whether the module matches upto a coding standard."
What is the difference between tuple and dictionary?,"One major difference between a tuple and a dictionary is that dictionary is mutable while a tuple is not. Meaning the content of a dictionary can be changed without changing it’s identity, but in tuple that’s not possible."
How can an object be copied in Python?,"Not all objects can be copied in Python, but most can. We ca use the “=” operator to copy an obect to a variable."
What are module and package in Python?,"Modules are the way to structure a program. Each Python program file is a module, importing other attributes and objects. The folder of a program is a package of modules. A package can have modules or subfolders."
What is object() function in Python?,In Python the object() function returns an empty object. New properties or methods cannot be added to this object.
What is the difference between NumPy and SciPy?,"NumPy stands for Numerical Python while SciPy stands for Scientific Python. NumPy is the basic library for defining arrays and simple mathematica problems, while SciPy is used for more complex problems like numerical integration and optimization and machine learning and so on."
What is the type () in Python?,type() is a built-in method which either returns the type of the object or returns a new type object based on the arguments passed.
What is reindexing in pandas?,Reindexing is the process of re-assigning the index of a pandas dataframe.
What is vstack() in numpy?,vstack() is a function to align rows vertically. All rows must have same number of elements.
